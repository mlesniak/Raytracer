[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mlesniak/raytracer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mlesniak/raytracer)

# Introduction

A simple raytracer. All algorithms, ideas and designs are motivated by the book

> An Introduction to Ray Tracing
> Andrew S. Glassner et al.
> 1989, The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics

Note that the current state of this project is :boom: hacky :boom:, i.e. the code is not yet refactored, structured or 
documented.

# Quality

As part of the build process we check the code quality using

- Checkstyle (in particular for source code formatting)
- FindBugs

The corresponding configuration files are stored in ```src/main/resrouces/codestyle```. If any of these tools emit a 
warning, the build fails.
